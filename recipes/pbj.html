        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The classic peanute butter and jelly sandwich! Yet another food I eat once a day 360 out of
            365 days in a year. Don't overlook this simple staple. It's got enough energy to take you from
            noon until night. I recommend whole wheat bread, but choose your edible container!
