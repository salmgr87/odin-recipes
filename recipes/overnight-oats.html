        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This <strong>delicious</strong> breakfast has been my go to for at least the last 10 years. 
            I can count on one hand the number of times I <em>haven't</em> had it for breakfast since I
            first started making it. It takes almost no time to make the night before, and I look 
            forward to my mornings every day. You can use whatever fruit you like, but this recipe calls for
            bananas, strawberries, and raisins. <strong>Old Fashion</strong> oats are the suggested type (rather
            than Quick Oats).
