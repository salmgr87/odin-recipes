        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This <strong>delicious</strong> breakfast has been my go to for at least the last 10 years. 
            I can count on one hand the number of times I <em>haven't</em> had it for breakfast since I
            first started making it. It takes almost no time to make the night before, and I look 
            forward to my mornings every day. You can use whatever fruit you like, but this recipe calls for
            bananas, strawberries, and raisins. <strong>Old Fashion</strong> oats are the suggested type (rather
            than Quick Oats).

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Old Fashion Oats</li>
            <li>Ground flaxseed</li>
            <li>Chia seeds</li>
            <li>Protein Powder</li>
            <li>Almond milk</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>1 banana</li>
            <li>4-5 strawberries</li>
            <li>Raisins</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour 1 heaping cup of Old Fashion oats into a container.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon of gound flaxseed.</li>
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon of chia seeds.</li>
            <li>In a large cup, mix one scoop of protein powder with half a cup of water and half
                a cup of almond milk. Stir well.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the protein shake into the container with the dry ingredients. Stir very well,
                otherwise the flaxseed will clump.
            </li>
            <li>Cut up the banana and straberries. Add them to the container. Add around a tablespoon 
                of raisins.
            </li>
            <li>Stir the fruit in, then cover the container and place it in the refrigerator. In 1 hour,
                it will be ready, but for best results, leave it in the fridge overnight!
            </li>

        </ol>
